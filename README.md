# Zippo
Get a zip full of a list of file URLs provided. 

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

POST a list of file URLs to `//zippo.yourdeployment.com?filename=package.zip` like so
```
file1.txt=https://s3.aws.com/file1&
file2.jpg=https://s3.aws.com/pic&
file3.pdf=https://bucket.googlecloud.com/data1&
dir1/more.txt=https://s3.aws.com/something&
```
And a download of the file you expect will start almost immediately.

If the information being downloaded is sensitive, use signed URLs to control access to data. Zippo does not cache or store the zipped data in any way. 

See [test.html](https://github.com/sudhirj/zippo/blob/master/test.html) for an example HTML form that triggers a download.
